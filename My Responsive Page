            <h3>PENETRATION TESTING</h3>
            <P>Penetration testing, also known as "ethical hacking," is like hiring a friendly hacker to try and break into your computer systems—before the bad guys do. The goal is to find weak spots in your security so they can be fixed before someone takes advantage of them. It helps keep your business safe from cyber attacks.

            <h3>FORENSICS ANALYSIS</h3>
            <P>Forensic analysis in cybersecurity is like being a digital detective. When something suspicious happens—like a data breach or hack—experts investigate what went wrong, how it happened, and who did it. They collect evidence, trace digital footprints, and help businesses understand the attack so it doesn’t happen again.
